# Content-Based-Recommendation-System-for-Cosmetic-Products
This project develops a content-based recommendation system for cosmetic products, focusing on moisturizers for dry skin. It uses word embeddings, t-SNE for dimensionality reduction, and Bokeh for interactive visualization of ingredient similarities to help users find suitable products based on their ingredient lists.
